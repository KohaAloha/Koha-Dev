if you
- just installed a fresh debian etch
- want to install koha
- don't want to strugle with apt configuration, weird dependancies conflit,
  and cpan install modules
this script does it for you

note:
    french doc. is more detailled for the moment (i apologize).

warning:
    Even if etch is always prefered, this script installs some lenny packages. 
    If you don't want to mix distribs for any reason, please don't use this script.

required:
	locales have to be allready configured configured

recommends:

	 .
	/!\ koha needs a local MTA. By default, courier-mta will be installed.
	    I recommend postfix but i won't decide for you (the choice of the MTA
	    relies on too many parameters).

	if you want to know the alternatives, type
	aptitude search '~Dprovides:mail-transport-agent'

go:
	- edit the first lines of the script to set some environement variables
	  (you can also use export to set variables out of the script)
	- from the shell, type
		sh install_koha_from_on_fesh_etch [install flags]

		flags are
		t: install koha from release or beta tarballs (default is git)
		b: install koha from beta tarballs (default is git)
		c: debian is still configured. It means that you exactly know the
		    required sources and the script asumes that those sources are
		    configured

	- answer to the questions

it's ready to use ...
