CONFIGURING THE TEST SUITE

Before you can run the test suite, you need to configure certain
information about the SIP server and the ILS data in the file
SIPtest.pm.

RUNNING THE TESTS

Every file tests a different protocol transaction.
Unfortunately, a lot of test cases are missing, but the basics
are tested, as are most of the simple error conditions (invalid
users, unknown items, checking in item that's not checked out).

To run a single test, just run

   perl -I.. <file>

If the test fails, the output should be pretty clear about what
went wrong (assuming you can read raw SIP packets).

To run all the tests, just type

   make test

Right now, that will run tests for functionality that isn't
supported in the Evergreen environment (the two main cases are
enable patron and hold management).  To run just the Evergreen tests, use

       make test-openils

which will run just the tests

	00sc_status.t
	01patron_status.t
	02patron_info.t
	03checkout.t
	06patron_enable.t
	08checkin.t
	09renew.t
	11item_info.t
	05block_patron.t

NOTE: the Block Patron tests are run last because "Patron Enable"
isn't supported.  Thus, after running the "Block Patron" test,
manual intervention is required to unblock the test patron.

The Renew All tests will fail when running the stub "ILS"
implementation unless there's only one ILS server running.  This
won't be a problem for any real backend implementation that
properly manages the database of users and items.
