The OpacHiddenItems syspref allow the user to define custom rules
for hiding specific items at opac.

YAML syntax is used for defining such rules.

Items can be hidden according to values from the items table:

field: [value1, value2, ...]

Example :
wthdrawn: [0, 1]
homebranch: [homebranch1, homebranch2]
