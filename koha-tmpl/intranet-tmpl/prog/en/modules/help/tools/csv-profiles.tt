<h1>CSV profiles</h1>

<p>CSV Profiles are created to define how you would like your cart or list to export.</p>

<h3>Add CSV Profiles</h3>

<p>To add a CSV Profile</p>

<ul>
	<li>Click 'CSV Profiles' from the Tools menu
<ul>
	<li>The 'Profile name' will appear on the export pull down list when choosing 'Download' from your cart or list</li>
    <li>The 'Profile description' is for your own benefit, but will also appear in the OPAC when patrons download content, so make sure it's clear to your patrons as well</li>
	<li>The 'CSV separator' is the character used to separate values and value groups</li>
    <li><strong>Tip:</strong> The most common option here is comma because most spreadsheet applications know how to open files split by commas.</li>
	<li>The 'Field separator' is the character used to separate duplicate fields
<ul>
    <li>Example: You may have multiple 650 fields and this is the character that will appear in between each one in the column</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The 'Subfield separator' is the character used to separate duplicate subfields
<ul>
	<li>Example: You may have multiple $a subfields in a field</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The 'Encoding' field lets you define the encoding used when saving the file</li>
    <li>Finally format your CSV file using the 'Profile MARC fields' fields
<ul>
    <li>Define which fields or subfields you want to export, separated by pipes. Example :200|210$a|301</li>
    <li><strong>Tip:</strong> You can also use your own headers (instead of the ones from Koha) by prefixing the field number with an header, followed by the equal sign. Example : Personal name=100|title=245$a|300</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>When you have entered in all of the information for you profile, simply click 'Submit' and you will be presented with a confirmation that your profile has been saved.</p>

<h3>Modify CSV Profiles</h3>

<p>Once you have created at least one CSV Profile an 'Edit profile' tab will appear next to the 'New profile' button.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Choose the profile you would like to edit and alter the necessary fields.</li>
    <li>After submitting your changes you will be presented with a confirmation message at the top of the screen</li>
    <li>To delete a profile, check the 'Delete selected profile' option before clicking 'Submit Query'</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using CSV Profiles</h3>

<p>Your CSV Profiles will appear on the export list or cart menu under the 'Download' button in both the staff client and the OPAC</p>
