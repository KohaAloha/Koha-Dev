Configuration Instructions
=============================

To use your gmail account as an SMTP server you will need to execute the following from a shell prompt.

(These steps are taken from http://jonspriggs.posterous.com/use-gmails-smtp-gateway-using-the-command-lin)

sudo apt-get install openssl xinetd

sudo tee /usr/bin/gmail-smtp <<EOF >/dev/null
#!/bin/sh
# Thanks to http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=918335 for this install guide
/usr/bin/openssl s_client -connect smtp.gmail.com:465 -quiet 2>/dev/null
EOF
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/gmail-smtp

sudo tee /etc/xinetd.d/gmail-smtp <<EOF >/dev/null
# default: on

service gmail-smtp
{
    disable         = no
    bind            = localhost
    port            = 10025
    socket_type     = stream
    protocol        = tcp
    wait            = no
    user            = root
    server          = /usr/bin/gmail-smtp
    type            = unlisted
}
EOF
sudo /etc/init.d/xinetd reload

Edit Mail/Sendmail.pm and set the port to 10025. (Note: This file will be located where ever your Perl libraries are.)

Script Setup Instructions
=============================

After successfully executing the above steps, you will need to run the process_message_queue.pl script with the
following syntax:

perl process_message_queue.pl -u librarian@foo.tld -p supersecret -m LOGIN

This, of course, assumes that you have all other scripts in place and functional to generate notices.

Misc Helpful Notes
=============================

NOTE: In order to debug problems, you can set the debug level in Mail/Sendmail.pm to 11 which will give plenty of
commentary to STDOUT.
