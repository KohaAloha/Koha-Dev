TRANSLATION TOOL, V3.0:
======================

This transation tool should greatly help Koha translators. It's composed of
2 scripts (with a number of associated perl module files):

 1. xgettext.pl, that extracts the texts in a template, and which is called by
    the script; and
 2. tmpl_process3.tmpl, which can do 3 things:
     a. create a file with all the "translatable strings" in all files in a
        directory (& its subdirectories),
     b. update an existing translation file, and
     c. rebuild translated templates from English & translation file.

Call tmpl_process3.pl --help to get a more detailed explanation. Some
additional explanations are also available by calling perldoc tmpl_process3.pl.

Warning: Those scripts relie upon 'gettext' set of tools. On Debian
         it is included in 'gettext' package.

HOW TO TRANSLATE Koha:
=====================

 1. Create your translation file (assuming your current directory is this
    directory, i.e., misc/translator):

        ./tmpl_process3.pl create -i ../../koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/en/ -s po/css_opac_fr_FR.po -r

    (In the above example, ../../koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/en/ contains the
    English templates in the "default" theme, and po/css_opac_fr_FR.po is where
    you want the generated PO file to appear. The use of relative paths for the
    English templates is recommended; it makes the resulting PO files slightly
    shorter and more usable in a team environment. Absolute paths are certainly
    fine, and might be better if there is only one translator for your
    language.)
 2. Translate your css_opac_fr_FR.po file using a text editor or a PO file
    translation tool.
 3. Create your translated templates:

        ./tmpl_process3.pl install -i ../../koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/en/ -o /home/paul/koha.dev/koha/koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/fr2/ -s po/css_opac_fr_FR.po -r

    (In the above example, /home/paul/koha.dev/koha/koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default
    /fr2/ is where you want your translated templates to be saved.)
 4. Copy images/css files in your new directory (as they are NOT moved by
    tmpl_process3.pl install).

If something changes in the English version:

 1. Update your translation file:

        ./tmpl_process3.pl update -i ../../koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/en/ -s po/css_opac_fr_FR.po -r

 2. Translate your newly updated css_opac_fr_FR.po file. Look for strings
    marked as "fuzzy" and strings that are not translated.
 3. Create your translated templates:

        ./tmpl_process3.pl install -i ../../koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/en/ -o /home/paul/koha.dev/koha/koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/fr2/ -s po/css_opac_fr_FR.po -r

 4. Copy new images/css files in your new directory if needed
